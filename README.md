This repository is created to support the community with data generated in our project entitled: "Capturing the genome variation to understand the drug selection loci and evolution of anthroponosis in Giardia."

## Databases available

* NAS genomes: FASTA file containing the genomes and aditional markers used for our enrichment protocol
* NAS bed: BED file containing non-redundant regions used for our enrichment protocol
* Scripts: Scripts generated in the project to reproduce the analysis and database generation
